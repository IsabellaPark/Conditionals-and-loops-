# Loops
# while loops

# while loop takes in a boolean experetion (T/F)
# Boolean operaters:
# Comparison operaters 
# let 3 = x
# x < 5 (less than 5)
# x > 5 (greater than 5)
# let x = 5
# x <= 5 (less than or equall to 5)
# x >= 5 (greater than or equall to 5)
# x == 5 (equall to 5)
# x != 5 (not equall to 5)

# Logical operaters
#and 
#or
#not

# A while loop will only run if the boolean experetion is true
# counter = 0
# while(counter <= 5):
#   print(counter)
#   counter = counter + 1

# for loops
# counter = 1
# for counter in range(6):
#   print(counter)

# counter = 0
# for counter in range(0, 5):
#   print(counter + 1)

#list od numbers 
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum = 0
# get the sum of all numbers
for numbers in range(1, 6):
  sum = sum + numbers 
  print(sum)
